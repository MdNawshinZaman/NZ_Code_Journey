#include<stdio.h>

//lets create a new function

void main(void) //here the first 'void' is called the return value, 'meow' is the name of my function, and the 2nd '(void)' is called the arguments to that function
{
/* when I moved the newly made function called 'meow' at the bottom after my main function,
there is a tiny error appearing, but when I typed 'void main (void)' at the top after #include,
my program knows that there is a function called 'meow'.
That means, I have declared the that there is a Hand made function named "void meow (void)"
As a result, the program search through the whole code for
'meow' function before executing and as a result, the error is gone :) */
